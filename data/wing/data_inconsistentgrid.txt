# how to get POD coefficients
1. apply SVD to highfi data -> get POD basis (d by r), POD coeff (r by n)
2. apply SVD to lowfi data -> get POD coeff (r by m)
3. do manifold alignment using highfi and lowfi POD coeff and get highfi-aligned lowfi POD coeff (r by m)
4. train krig model using highfi POD coeff (r by n) and lowfi POD coeff (r by m)
5. predict POD coeff for new input

* for budget allocation, what if n is smaller than r?
1. for budget 10, r=9 --> n=7, m = 21

''' data: crm_coarse-grid_4DV_N1000_slim.h5
We will use von Mises stress data - GRID/CELL_DATA/vonMisesStress_2p5g_psi (1000, 5062) and 
displacement data - GRID/GRID/POINT_DATA/disp_2p5g_inch (1000, 2160, 3)

The h5 file is containing:

## Coordinates data - GRID/Points (1000, 2160, 3) will be used to visualize the stress and displacement data

#### input data - STATE/DV_Values (1000, 4)
#### The dataset has 4 input parmaeters: sweep, dihedral, wing tip twist, wing span
#### 1000 samples are drew from the design bounds of Table 3 using the Latin Hypercube Sampling


#### LF resolution: 5062 elements
#### nodes: 2160 (guessed from GRID/Points)
