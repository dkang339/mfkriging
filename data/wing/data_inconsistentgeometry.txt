# Description
1. HF: structural stress data of CRM wing with baseline structural layout. The layout has high-rib count with 32 inches of rib spacing. This dataset is the same dataset with the high fidelity dataset in data_inconsistentgrid.
2. LF: structural stress data of CRM wing with auxiliary structural layout. The layout has low-rib count with higher rib spacing than the high fidelity dataset. (Rib spacing value is not specified.)

# computational cost
1. HF: 1 (5.4 CPU sec)
2. LF: 0.8704 (4.7 CPU sec)

# number of spatial dimension
1. HF: 66663 elements (same number of ribs with data_inconsistentgrid)
2. LF: 65,000 elements
